## Project title: Philosophy Website

1. Project Overview

The goal of this website is to present the history and practices of philosophy. It will discuss the core branches of philosophy today in addition to the methods it is practiced in.

2. Resources

The wiki philosophy page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy and google images.

3. Audience

This is an informational site and will be geared towards anyone who wants to learn. It is most likely that the instructors will view this and few others.

4. Message

I want to maintain a neutral message and just provide information about the field and history of philosophy.


5. Tone

I think the tone should be neutral as well - I want to highlight the differences in philosophy based on where in the world is practiced. The tone then should be pensive and serious.

6. Visual Style

I want the website to be clean and simple. It should be easy to navigate and focus on exhibiting information and images. I want to use serif fonts and use relatively few things besides the text and images. The colors should be bold and use a small color palette.
