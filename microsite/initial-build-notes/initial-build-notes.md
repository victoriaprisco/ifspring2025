# Initial Build Notes

Looks great!

Some small feedback, but otherwise I think it's good.

- The orange-y gradient on the homepage gets cut off and begins again so there’s this harsh line, do you think that it could be one continuous gradient the whole screen?
- If I click on “Start the Journey Here”, it opens a new tab (this should be a small HTML fix), I don’t think it should
- The floating menu is cool, do you think it could just say “Navigation” instead of “Floating Menu”
