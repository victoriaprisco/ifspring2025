# Mockup Review

I really like the orange color version over the blue verison, so let's stick with that one.

One thing I think could help is being more cohesive throughout the site, so the fonts used should be more consistent (the nav bar) and I think the orange color can be reused more in parts with large blocks of text. Maybe we could make certain sections have the orange background color and different color text, just to give some variety but keep it consistent with the homepage. 

Small thing, but the nav bar at the top the logo should link to the homepage instead of a "top" item in the nav bar itself.

In terms of content, I know wiki throws in the citation references (the square brackets with numbers in them), so if you could remove those that would be great, I know its tedious :(
