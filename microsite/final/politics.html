      <p>
        Many of Hume's political ideas, such as limited government, private
        property when there is scarcity, and constitutionalism, are first
        principles of liberalism. Thomas Jefferson banned the History from
        University of Virginia, feeling that it had "spread universal toryism
        over the land." By comparison, Samuel Johnson thought Hume to be "a Tory
        by chance [...] for he has no principle. If he is anything, he is a
        Hobbist." A major concern of Hume's political philosophy is the
        importance of the rule of law. He also stresses throughout his political
        essays the importance of moderation in politics, public spirit, and
        regard to the community.

        Throughout the period of the American Revolution, Hume had varying
        views. For instance, in 1768 he encouraged total revolt on the part of
        the Americans. In 1775, he became certain that a revolution would take
        place and said that he believed in the American principle and wished the
        British government would let them be. Hume's influence on some of the
        Founders can be seen in Benjamin Franklin's suggestion at the
        Philadelphia Convention of 1787 that no high office in any branch of
        government should receive a salary, which is a suggestion Hume had made
        in his emendation of James Harrington's Oceana.

        The legacy of religious civil war in 18th-century Scotland, combined
        with the relatively recent memory of the 1715 and 1745 Jacobite risings,
        had fostered in Hume a distaste for enthusiasm and
        factionalism.[citation needed] These appeared to him to threaten the
        fragile and nascent political and social stability of a country that was
        deeply politically and religiously divided.[failed verification] Hume
        thought that society is best governed by a general and impartial system
        of laws; he is less concerned about the form of government that
        administers these laws, so long as it does so fairly. However, he also
        clarified that a republic must produce laws, while "monarchy, when
        absolute, contains even something repugnant to law."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hume expressed suspicion of attempts to reform society in ways that
        departed from long-established custom, and he counselled peoples not to
        resist their governments except in cases of the most egregious tyranny.
        However, he resisted aligning himself with either of Britain's two
        political parties, the Whigs and the Tories, explaining that "my views
        of things are more conformable to Whig principles; my representations of
        persons to Tory prejudices".
      </p>
      <p>
        The scholar Jerry Z. Muller argues that Hume's political thoughts have
        characteristics that later became typical for American and British
        conservatism, which contain more positive views of capitalism than
        conservatism does elsewhere. Canadian philosopher Neil McArthur writes
        that Hume believed that we should try to balance our demands for liberty
        with the need for strong authority, without sacrificing either. McArthur
        characterises Hume as a "precautionary conservative," whose actions
        would have been "determined by prudential concerns about the
        consequences of change, which often demand we ignore our own principles
        about what is ideal or even legitimate." Hume supported the liberty of
        the press, and was sympathetic to democracy, when suitably constrained.
        American historian Douglass Adair has argued that Hume was a major
        inspiration for James Madison's writings, and the essay "Federalist No.
        10" in particular.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hume offered his view on the best type of society in an essay titled
        "Idea of a Perfect Commonwealth", which lays out what he thought was the
        best form of government. He hoped that "in some future age, an
        opportunity might be afforded of reducing the theory to practice, either
        by a dissolution of some old government, or by the combination of men to
        form a new one, in some distant part of the world". He defended a strict
        separation of powers, decentralisation, extending the franchise to
        anyone who held property of value and limiting the power of the clergy.
        The system of the Swiss militia was proposed as the best form of
        protection. Elections were to take place on an annual basis and
        representatives were to be unpaid. Political philosophers Leo Strauss
        and Joseph Cropsey, writing of Hume's thoughts about "the wise
        statesman", note that he "will bear a reverence to what carries the
        marks of age." Also, if he wishes to improve a constitution, his
        innovations will take account of the "ancient fabric", in order not to
        disturb society.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the political analysis of philosopher George Holland Sabine, the
        scepticism of Hume extended to the doctrine of government by consent. He
        notes that "allegiance is a habit enforced by education and consequently
        as much a part of human nature as any other motive."
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 1770s, Hume was critical of British policies toward the American
        colonies and advocated for American independence. He wrote in 1771 that
        "our union with Americaâ€¦in the nature of things, cannot long subsist."

    <h2>Economic Thought</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Hume expressed his economic views in his Political Discourses, which
        were incorporated in Essays and Treatises as Part II of Essays, Moral
        and Political. To what extent he was influenced by Adam Smith is
        difficult to assess; however, both of them had similar principles
        supported from historical events. At the same time Hume did not
        demonstrate concrete system of economic theory which could be observed
        in Smith's Wealth of Nations. However, he introduced several new ideas
        around which the "classical economics" of the 18th century was built.
        Through his discussions on politics, Hume developed many ideas that are
        prevalent in the field of economics. This includes ideas on private
        property, inflation, and foreign trade. Referring to his essay "Of
        the Balance of Trade", economist Paul Krugman (2012) has remarked that
        "David Hume created what I consider the first true economic model."
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast to Locke, Hume believes that private property is not a
        natural right. Hume argues it is justified, because resources are
        limited. Private property would be an unjustified, "idle ceremonial," if
        all goods were unlimited and available freely. Hume also believed
        in an unequal distribution of property, because perfect equality would
        destroy the ideas of thrift and industry. Perfect equality would thus
        lead to impoverishment.
      </p>
      <p>
        David Hume anticipated modern monetarism. First, Hume contributed to the
        theory of quantity and of interest rate. Hume has been credited with
        being the first to prove that, on an abstract level, there is no
        quantifiable amount of nominal money that a country needs to thrive. He
        understood that there was a difference between nominal and real money.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, Hume has a theory of causation which fits in with the
        Chicago-school "black box" approach. According to Hume, cause and effect
        are related only through correlation. Hume shared the belief with modern
        monetarists that changes in the supply of money can affect consumption
        and investment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, Hume was a vocal advocate of a stable private sector, though
        also having some non-monetarist aspects to his economic philosophy.
        Having a stated preference for rising prices, for instance, Hume
        considered government debt to be a sort of substitute for actual money,
        referring to such debt as "a kind of paper credit." He also believed in
        heavy taxation, believing that it increases effort. Hume's economic
        approach evidently resembles his other philosophies, in that he does not
        choose one side indefinitely, but sees gray in the situation.
