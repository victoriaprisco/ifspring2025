      <p>
        Hume's writings on ethics began in the 1740 Treatise and were refined in
        his An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals (1751). He understood
        feeling, rather than knowing, as that which governs ethical actions,
        stating that "moral decisions are grounded in moral sentiment." Arguing
        that reason cannot be behind morality, he wrote:
      </p>
      <p>
        Morals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason itself is
        utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality, therefore,
        are not conclusions of our reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hume's moral sentimentalism was shared by his close friend Adam
        Smith,[failed verification] and the two were mutually influenced by the
        moral reflections of their older contemporary, Francis Hutcheson. Peter
        Singer claims that Hume's argument that morals cannot have a rational
        basis alone "would have been enough to earn him a place in the history
        of ethics."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hume also put forward the is–ought problem, later known as Hume's Law,
        denying the possibility of logically deriving what ought to be from what
        is. According to the Treatise (1740), in every system of morality that
        Hume has read, the author begins by stating facts about the world as it
        is but always ends up suddenly referring to what ought to be the case.
        Hume demands that a reason should be given for inferring what ought to
        be the case, from what is the case. This is because it "seems altogether
        inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hume's theory of ethics has been influential in modern-day meta-ethical
        theory, helping to inspire emotivism, and ethical expressivism and
        non-cognitivism,[failed verification] as well as Allan Gibbard's general
        theory of moral judgment and judgments of rationality.

    <h2>Problem of Miracles</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        In his discussion of miracles, Hume argues that we should not believe
        miracles have occurred and that they do not therefore provide us with
        any reason to think God exists. In An Enquiry Concerning Human
        Understanding (Section 10), Hume defines a miracle as "a transgression
        of a law of nature by a particular volition of the Deity, or by the
        interposition of some invisible agent". Hume says we believe an event
        that has frequently occurred is likely to occur again, but we also take
        into account those instances where the event did not occur:
      </p>
      <p>
        A wise man ... considers which side is supported by the greater number
        of experiments. ... A hundred instances or experiments on one side, and
        fifty on another, afford a doubtful expectation of any event; though a
        hundred uniform experiments, with only one that is contradictory,
        reasonably beget a pretty strong degree of assurance. In all cases, we
        must balance the opposite experiments ... and deduct the smaller number
        from the greater, in order to know the exact force of the superior
        evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hume discusses the testimony of those who report miracles. He wrote that
        testimony might be doubted even from some great authority in case the
        facts themselves are not credible: "[T]he evidence, resulting from the
        testimony, admits of a diminution, greater or less, in proportion as the
        fact is more or less unusual."
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Hume leaves open the possibility for miracles to occur and be
        reported, he offers various arguments against this ever having happened
        in history. He points out that people often lie, and they have good
        reasons to lie about miracles occurring either because they believe they
        are doing so for the benefit of their religion or because of the fame
        that results. Furthermore, people by nature enjoy relating miracles they
        have heard without caring for their veracity and thus miracles are
        easily transmitted even when false. Also, Hume notes that miracles seem
        to occur mostly in "ignorant and barbarous nations" and times, and
        the reason they do not occur in the civilised societies is such
        societies are not awed by what they know to be natural events. Hume
        recognizes that over a long period of time, various coincidences can
        provide the appearance of intention. Finally, the miracles of each
        religion argue against all other religions and their miracles, and so
        even if a proportion of all reported miracles across the world fit
        Hume's requirement for belief, the miracles of each religion make the
        other less likely.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hume was extremely pleased with his argument against miracles in his
        Enquiry. He states, "I flatter myself, that I have discovered an
        argument of a like nature, which, if just, will, with the wise and
        learned, be an everlasting check to all kinds of superstitious delusion,
        and consequently, will be useful as long as the world endures."
        Thus, Hume's argument against miracles had a more abstract basis founded
        upon the scrutiny, not just primarily of miracles, but of all forms of
        belief systems. It is a commonsense notion of veracity based upon
        epistemological evidence, and founded on a principle of rationality,
        proportionality and reasonability.
      </p>
      <p>
        The criterion for assessing Hume's belief system is based on the balance
        of probability whether something is more likely than not to have
        occurred. Since the weight of empirical experience contradicts the
        notion for the existence of miracles, such accounts should be treated
        with scepticism. Further, the myriad of accounts of miracles contradict
        one another, as some people who receive miracles will aim to prove the
        authority of Jesus, whereas others will aim to prove the authority of
        Muhammad or some other religious prophet or deity. These various
        differing accounts weaken the overall evidential power of
        miracles.[failed verification]
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite all this, Hume observes that belief in miracles is popular, and
        that "the gazing populace… receive greedily, without examination,
        whatever soothes superstition, and promotes wonder."
      </p>
      <p>
        Critics have argued that Hume's position assumes the character of
        miracles and natural laws prior to any specific examination of miracle
        claims, thus it amounts to a subtle form of begging the question. To
        assume that testimony is a homogeneous reference group seems unwise- to
        compare private miracles with public miracles, unintellectual observers
        with intellectual observers and those who have little to gain and much
        to lose with those with much to gain and little to lose is not
        convincing to many. Indeed, many have argued that miracles not only do
        not contradict the laws of nature but require the laws of nature to be
        intelligible as miraculous, and thus subverting the law of nature. For
        example, William Adams remarks that "there must be an ordinary course of
        nature before anything can be extraordinary. There must be a stream
        before anything can be interrupted." They have also noted that it
        requires an appeal to inductive inference, as none have observed every
        part of nature nor examined every possible miracle claim, for instance
        those in the future. This, in Hume's philosophy, was especially
        problematic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Little appreciated is the voluminous literature either foreshadowing
        Hume, in the likes of Thomas Sherlock or directly responding to and
        engaging with Hume—from William Paley, William Adams, John
        Douglas, John Leland, and George Campbell, among others.
        Regarding the latter, it is rumoured that, having read Campbell's
        Dissertation, Hume remarked that "the Scotch theologue had beaten
        him."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hume's main argument concerning miracles is that miracles by definition
        are singular events that differ from the established laws of nature.
        Such natural laws are codified as a result of past experiences.
        Therefore, a miracle is a violation of all prior experience and thus
        incapable on this basis of reasonable belief. However, the probability
        that something has occurred in contradiction of all past experience
        should always be judged to be less than the probability that either
        one's senses have deceived one, or the person recounting the miraculous
        occurrence is lying or mistaken, Hume would say, all of which he had
        past experience of. For Hume, this refusal to grant credence does not
        guarantee correctness. He offers the example of an Indian Prince, who,
        having grown up in a hot country, refuses to believe that water has
        frozen. By Hume's lights, this refusal is not wrong and the prince
        "reasoned justly;" it is presumably only when he has had extensive
        experience of the freezing of water that he has warrant to believe that
        the event could occur.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, for Hume, either the miraculous event will become a recurrent event
        or else it will never be rational to believe it occurred. The connection
        to religious belief is left unexplained throughout, except for the close
        of his discussion where Hume notes the reliance of Christianity upon
        testimony of miraculous occurrences. He makes an ironic remark that
        anyone who "is moved by faith to assent" to revealed testimony "is
        conscious of a continued miracle in his own person, which subverts all
        principles of his understanding, and gives him a determination to
        believe what is most contrary to custom and experience." Hume
        writes that "All the testimony whichever was really given for any
        miracle, or ever will be given, is a subject of derision."
