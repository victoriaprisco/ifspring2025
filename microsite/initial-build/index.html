    <h1>David Hume</h1>

    <p>
      David Hume (/hjuːm/; born David Home; 7 May 1711 – 25 August 1776) was a
      Scottish philosopher, historian, economist, and essayist who was best
      known for his highly influential system of empiricism, philosophical
      scepticism and metaphysical naturalism. Beginning with A Treatise of
      Human Nature (1739–40), Hume strove to create a naturalistic science of
      man that examined the psychological basis of human nature. Hume followed
      John Locke in rejecting the existence of innate ideas, concluding that all
      human knowledge derives solely from experience. This places him with
      Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and George Berkeley as an
      empiricist.
    </p>

      Hume argued that inductive reasoning and belief in causality cannot be
      justified rationally; instead, they result from custom and mental habit.
      We never actually perceive that one event causes another but only
      experience the "constant conjunction" of events. This problem of induction
      means that to draw any causal inferences from past experience, it is
      necessary to presuppose that the future will resemble the past; this
      metaphysical presupposition cannot itself be grounded in prior
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      An opponent of philosophical rationalists, Hume held that passions rather
      than reason govern human behaviour, famously proclaiming that "Reason is,
      and ought only to be the slave of the passions." Hume was also a
      sentimentalist who held that ethics are based on emotion or sentiment
      rather than abstract moral principle. He maintained an early commitment to
      naturalistic explanations of moral phenomena and is usually accepted by
      historians of European philosophy to have first clearly expounded the
      is–ought problem, or the idea that a statement of fact alone can never
      give rise to a normative conclusion of what ought to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hume denied that humans have an actual conception of the self, positing
      that we experience only a bundle of sensations, and that the self is
      nothing more than this bundle of perceptions connected by an association
      of ideas. Hume's compatibilist theory of free will takes causal
      determinism as fully compatible with human freedom. His philosophy of
      religion, including his rejection of miracles, and critique of the
      argument from design for God's existence, were especially controversial
      for their time. Hume left a legacy that affected utilitarianism, logical
      positivism, the philosophy of science, early analytic philosophy,
      cognitive science, theology, and many other fields and thinkers. Immanuel
      Kant credited Hume as the inspiration that had awakened him from his
      "dogmatic slumbers."
