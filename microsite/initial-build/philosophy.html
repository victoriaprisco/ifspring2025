    <h2>Free Will, Determinism, and Responsibility</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Hume, along with Thomas Hobbes, is cited as a classical compatibilist
        about the notions of freedom and determinism. Compatibilism seeks to
        reconcile human freedom with the mechanist view that human beings are
        part of a deterministic universe, which is completely governed by
        physical laws. Hume, on this point, was influenced greatly by the
        scientific revolution, particularly by Sir Isaac Newton. Hume argued
        that the dispute between freedom and determinism continued over 2000
        years due to ambiguous terminology. He wrote: "From this circumstance
        alone, that a controversy has been long kept on foot…we may presume that
        there is some ambiguity in the expression," and that different
        disputants use different meanings for the same terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hume defines the concept of necessity as "the uniformity, observable in
        the operations of nature; where similar objects are constantly conjoined
        together," and liberty as "a power of acting or not acting, according to
        the determinations of the will." He then argues that, according to these
        definitions, not only are the two compatible, but liberty requires
        necessity. For if our actions were not necessitated in the above sense,
        they would "have so little in connexion with motives, inclinations and
        circumstances, that one does not follow with a certain degree of
        uniformity from the other." But if our actions are not thus connected to
        the will, then our actions can never be free: they would be matters of
        "chance; which is universally allowed to have no existence." Australian
        philosopher John Passmore writes that confusion has arisen because
        "necessity" has been taken to mean "necessary connexion." Once this has
        been abandoned, Hume argues that "liberty and necessity will be found
        not to be in conflict one with another."
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, Hume goes on to argue that in order to be held morally
        responsible, it is required that our behaviour be caused or
        necessitated, for, as he wrote:
      </p>
      <p>
        Actions are, by their very nature, temporary and perishing; and where
        they proceed not from some cause in the character and disposition of the
        person who performed them, they can neither redound to his honour, if
        good; nor infamy, if evil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hume describes the link between causality and our capacity to rationally
        make a decision from this an inference of the mind. Human beings assess
        a situation based upon certain predetermined events and from that form a
        choice. Hume believes that this choice is made spontaneously. Hume calls
        this form of decision making the liberty of spontaneity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Education writer Richard Wright considers that Hume's position rejects a
        famous moral puzzle attributed to French philosopher Jean Buridan. The
        Buridan's ass puzzle describes a donkey that is hungry. This donkey has
        separate bales of hay on both sides, which are of equal distances from
        him. The problem concerns which bale the donkey chooses. Buridan was
        said to believe that the donkey would die, because he has no autonomy.
        The donkey is incapable of forming a rational decision as there is no
        motive to choose one bale of hay over the other. However, human beings
        are different, because a human who is placed in a position where he is
        forced to choose one loaf of bread over another will make a decision to
        take one in lieu of the other. For Buridan, humans have the capacity of
        autonomy, and he recognises the choice that is ultimately made will be
        based on chance, as both loaves of bread are exactly the same. However,
        Wright says that Hume completely rejects this notion, arguing that a
        human will spontaneously act in such a situation because he is faced
        with impending death if he fails to do so. Such a decision is not made
        on the basis of chance, but rather on necessity and spontaneity, given
        the prior predetermined events leading up to the predicament.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hume's argument is supported by modern-day compatibilists such as R. E.
        Hobart, a pseudonym of philosopher Dickinson S. Miller. However, P. F.
        Strawson argued that the issue of whether we hold one another morally
        responsible does not ultimately depend on the truth or falsity of a
        metaphysical thesis such as determinism. This is because our so holding
        one another is a non-rational human sentiment that is not predicated on
        such theses.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Induction and Causation</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        The cornerstone of Hume's epistemology is the problem of induction. This
        may be the area of Hume's thought where his scepticism about human
        powers of reason is most pronounced. The problem revolves around the
        plausibility of inductive reasoning, that is, reasoning from the
        observed behaviour of objects to their behaviour when unobserved. As
        Hume wrote, induction concerns how things behave when they go "beyond
        the present testimony of the senses, or the records of our memory". Hume
        argues that we tend to believe that things behave in a regular manner,
        meaning that patterns in the behaviour of objects seem to persist into
        the future, and throughout the unobserved present. Hume's argument is
        that we cannot rationally justify the claim that nature will continue to
        be uniform, as justification comes in only two varieties—demonstrative
        reasoning and probable reasoning[iii]—and both of these are inadequate.
        With regard to demonstrative reasoning, Hume argues that the uniformity
        principle cannot be demonstrated, as it is "consistent and conceivable"
        that nature might stop being regular. Turning to probable reasoning,
        Hume argues that we cannot hold that nature will continue to be uniform
        because it has been in the past. As this is using the very sort of
        reasoning (induction) that is under question, it would be circular
        reasoning. Thus, no form of justification will rationally warrant our
        inductive inferences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hume's solution to this problem is to argue that, rather than reason,
        natural instinct explains the human practice of making inductive
        inferences. He asserts that "Nature, by an absolute and uncontroulable
        [sic] necessity has determin'd us to judge as well as to breathe and
        feel." In 1985, and in agreement with Hume, John D. Kenyon writes:
      </p>
      <p>
        Reason might manage to raise a doubt about the truth of a conclusion of
        natural inductive inference just for a moment ... but the sheer
        agreeableness of animal faith will protect us from excessive caution and
        sterile suspension of belief.
      </p>
      <p>
        Others, such as Charles Sanders Peirce, have demurred from Hume's
        solution, while some, such as Kant and Karl Popper, have thought that
        Hume's analysis has "posed a most fundamental challenge to all human
        knowledge claims".
      </p>
      <p>
        The notion of causation is closely linked to the problem of induction.
        According to Hume, we reason inductively by associating constantly
        conjoined events. It is the mental act of association that is the basis
        of our concept of causation. At least three interpretations of Hume's
        theory of causation are represented in the literature:
      </p>
      <p>
        the logical positivist; the sceptical realist; and the quasi-realist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hume acknowledged that there are events constantly unfolding, and
        humanity cannot guarantee that these events are caused by prior events
        or are independent instances. He opposed the widely accepted theory of
        causation that 'all events have a specific course or reason'. Therefore,
        Hume crafted his own theory of causation, formed through his empiricist
        and sceptic beliefs. He split causation into two realms: "All the
        objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided into two
        kinds, to wit, Relations of Ideas, and Matters of Fact." Relations of
        Ideas are a priori and represent universal bonds between ideas that mark
        the cornerstones of human thought. Matters of Fact are dependent on the
        observer and experience. They are often not universally held to be true
        among multiple persons. Hume was an Empiricist, meaning he believed
        "causes and effects are discoverable not by reason, but by experience".
        He goes on to say that, even with the perspective of the past, humanity
        cannot dictate future events because thoughts of the past are limited,
        compared to the possibilities for the future. Hume's separation between
        Matters of Fact and Relations of Ideas is often referred to as "Hume's
        fork."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hume explains his theory of causation and causal inference by division
        into three different parts. In these three branches he explains his
        ideas and compares and contrasts his views to his predecessors. These
        branches are the Critical Phase, the Constructive Phase, and Belief. In
        the Critical Phase, Hume denies his predecessors' theories of causation.
        Next, he uses the Constructive Phase to resolve any doubts the reader
        may have had while observing the Critical Phase. "Habit or Custom" mends
        the gaps in reasoning that occur without the human mind even realising
        it. Associating ideas has become second nature to the human mind. It
        "makes us expect for the future, a similar train of events with those
        which have appeared in the past". However, Hume says that this
        association cannot be trusted because the span of the human mind to
        comprehend the past is not necessarily applicable to the wide and
        distant future. This leads him to the third branch of causal inference,
        Belief. Belief is what drives the human mind to hold that expectancy of
        the future is based on past experience. Throughout his explanation of
        causal inference, Hume is arguing that the future is not certain to be
        repetition of the past and that the only way to justify induction is
        through uniformity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The logical positivist interpretation is that Hume analyses causal
        propositions, such as "A causes B", in terms of regularities in
        perception: "A causes B" is equivalent to "Whenever A-type events
        happen, B-type ones follow", where "whenever" refers to all possible
        perceptions. In his Treatise of Human Nature, Hume wrote:
      </p>
      <p>
        Power and necessity…are…qualities of perceptions, not of objects…felt by
        the soul and not perceiv'd externally in bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        This view is rejected by sceptical realists, who argue that Hume thought
        that causation amounts to more than just the regular succession of
        events.[ii] Hume said that, when two events are causally conjoined, a
        necessary connection underpins the conjunction:
      </p>
      <p>
        Shall we rest contented with these two relations of contiguity and
        succession, as affording a complete idea of causation? By no means…there
        is a necessary connexion to be taken into consideration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Angela Coventry writes that, for Hume, "there is nothing in any
        particular instance of cause and effect involving external objects which
        suggests the idea of power or necessary connection" and "we are ignorant
        of the powers that operate between objects". However, while denying the
        possibility of knowing the powers between objects, Hume accepted the
        causal principle, writing: "I never asserted so absurd a proposition as
        that something could arise without a cause."
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been argued that, while Hume did not think that causation is
        reducible to pure regularity, he was not a fully-fledged realist either.
        Simon Blackburn calls this a quasi-realist reading, saying that "Someone
        talking of cause is voicing a distinct mental set: he is by no means in
        the same state as someone merely describing regular sequences." In
        Hume's words, "nothing is more usual than to apply to external bodies
        every internal sensation, which they occasion".
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Bundle Theory of Personal Identity</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Empiricist philosophers, such as Hume and Berkeley, favoured the bundle
        theory of personal identity. In this theory, "the mind itself, far
        from being an independent power, is simply 'a bundle of perceptions'
        without unity or cohesive quality". The self is nothing but a
        bundle of experiences linked by the relations of causation and
        resemblance; or, more accurately, the empirically warranted idea of the
        self is just the idea of such a bundle. According to Hume:
      </p>
      <p>
        For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I
        always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold,
        light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can catch
        myself at any time without a perception, and never can observe any thing
        but the perception. When my perceptions are removed for any time, as by
        sound sleep; so long I am insensible of myself, and may truly be said
        not to exist.
      </p>
      <p>— A Treatise of Human Nature, Book I.iv, section 6</p>
      <p>
        This view is supported by, for example, positivist interpreters, who
        have seen Hume as suggesting that terms such as "self", "person", or
        "mind" refer to collections of "sense-contents". A modern-day version of
        the bundle theory of the mind has been advanced by Derek Parfit in his
        Reasons and Persons.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, some philosophers have criticised Hume's bundle-theory
        interpretation of personal identity. They argue that distinct selves can
        have perceptions that stand in relation to similarity and causality.
        Thus, perceptions must already come parcelled into distinct "bundles"
        before they can be associated according to the relations of similarity
        and causality. In other words, the mind must already possess a unity
        that cannot be generated, or constituted, by these relations alone.
        Since the bundle-theory interpretation portrays Hume as answering an
        ontological question, philosophers like Galen Strawson see Hume as not
        very concerned with such questions and have queried whether this view is
        really Hume's. Instead, Strawson suggests that Hume might have been
        answering an epistemological question about the causal origin of our
        concept of the self. In the Appendix to the Treatise, Hume declares
        himself dissatisfied with his earlier account of personal identity in
        Book 1. Corliss Swain notes that "Commentators agree that if Hume did
        find some new problem" when he reviewed the section on personal
        identity, "he wasn't forthcoming about its nature in the Appendix." One
        interpretation of Hume's view of the self, argued for by philosopher and
        psychologist James Giles, is that Hume is not arguing for a bundle
        theory, which is a form of reductionism, but rather for an eliminative
        view of the self. Rather than reducing the self to a bundle of
        perceptions, Hume rejects the idea of the self altogether. On this
        interpretation, Hume is proposing a "no-self theory" and thus has much
        in common with Buddhist thought (see anattā). Psychologist Alison Gopnik
        has argued that Hume was in a position to learn about Buddhist thought
        during his time in France in the 1730s.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Practical Reason</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Practical reason relates to whether standards or principles exist that
        are also authoritative for all rational beings, dictating people's
        intentions and actions. Hume is mainly considered an anti-rationalist,
        denying the possibility for practical reason, although other
        philosophers such as Christine Korsgaard, Jean Hampton, and Elijah
        Millgram claim that Hume is not so much of an anti-rationalist as he is
        just a sceptic of practical reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hume denied the existence of practical reason as a principle because he
        claimed reason does not have any effect on morality, since morality is
        capable of producing effects in people that reason alone cannot create.
        As Hume explains in A Treatise of Human Nature (1740):: 457 
      </p>
      <p>
        Morals excite passions, and produce or prevent actions. Reason of itself
        is utterly impotent in this particular. The rules of morality,
        therefore, are not conclusions of our reason."
      </p>
      <p>
        Since practical reason is supposed to regulate our actions (in theory),
        Hume denied practical reason on the grounds that reason cannot directly
        oppose passions. As Hume puts it, "Reason is, and ought only to be the
        slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to
        serve and obey them." Reason is less significant than any passion
        because reason has no original influence, while "A passion is an
        original existence, or, if you will, modification of
        existence.": 415 
      </p>
      <p>
        Practical reason is also concerned with the value of actions rather than
        the truth of propositions, so Hume believed that reason's
        shortcoming of affecting morality proved that practical reason could not
        be authoritative for all rational beings, since morality was essential
        for dictating people's intentions and actions.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Philosophy of Religion</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        Philosopher Paul Russell (2005) contends that Hume wrote "on almost
        every central question in the philosophy of religion", and that these
        writings "are among the most important and influential contributions on
        this topic." Touching on the philosophy, psychology, history, and
        anthropology of religious thought, Hume's 1757 dissertation "The Natural
        History of Religion" argues that the monotheistic religions of Judaism,
        Christianity, and Islam all derive from earlier polytheistic religions.
        He went on to suggest that all religious belief "traces, in the end, to
        dread of the unknown". Hume had also written on religious subjects in
        the first Enquiry, as well as later in the Dialogues Concerning Natural
        Religion.
      </p>
      <h3>Religious views</h3>
      <p>
        Although he wrote a great deal about religion, Hume's personal views
        have been the subject of much debate.[iv] Some modern critics have
        described Hume's religious views as agnostic or have described him as a
        "Pyrrhonian skeptic". Contemporaries considered him to be an atheist, or
        at least un-Christian, enough so that the Church of Scotland seriously
        considered bringing charges of infidelity against him. Evidence of his
        un-Christian beliefs can especially be found in his writings on
        miracles, in which he attempts to separate historical method from the
        narrative accounts of miracles. Nevertheless, modern scholars have
        tended to dismiss the claims of Hume's contemporaries describing him as
        an atheist as coming from religiously intolerant people who did not
        understand Hume’s philosophy. The fact that contemporaries suspected him
        of atheism is exemplified by a story Hume liked to tell:
      </p>
      <p>
        The best theologian he ever met, he used to say, was the old Edinburgh
        fishwife who, having recognized him as Hume the atheist, refused to pull
        him out of the bog into which he had fallen until he declared he was a
        Christian and repeated the Lord's prayer.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in works such as "Of Superstition and Enthusiasm", Hume
        specifically seems to support the standard religious views of his time
        and place. This still meant that he could be very critical of the
        Catholic Church, dismissing it with the standard Protestant accusations
        of superstition and idolatry,: 70  as well as dismissing as idolatry
        what his compatriots saw as uncivilised beliefs. He also considered
        extreme Protestant sects, the members of which he called "enthusiasts",
        to be corrupters of religion. By contrast, in "The Natural History of
        Religion", Hume presents arguments suggesting that polytheism had much
        to commend it over monotheism. Additionally, when mentioning religion as
        a factor in his History of England, Hume uses it to show the deleterious
        effect it has on human progress. In his Treatise of Human Nature, Hume
        wrote: "Generally speaking, the errors in religions are dangerous; those
        in philosophy only ridiculous."
      </p>
      <p>
        Lou Reich (1998) argues that Hume was a religious naturalist and rejects
        interpretations of Hume as an atheist. Paul Russell (2008) writes that
        Hume was plainly sceptical about religious belief, although perhaps not
        to the extent of complete atheism. He suggests that Hume's position is
        best characterised by the term "irreligion," while philosopher David
        O'Connor (2013) argues that Hume's final position was "weakly deistic".
        For O'Connor, Hume's "position is deeply ironic. This is because, while
        inclining towards a weak form of deism, he seriously doubts that we can
        ever find a sufficiently favourable balance of evidence to justify
        accepting any religious position." He adds that Hume "did not believe in
        the God of standard theism ... but he did not rule out all concepts of
        deity", and that "ambiguity suited his purposes, and this creates
        difficulty in definitively pinning down his final position on religion".
      </p>
      <h3>Design argument</h3>
      <p>
        One of the traditional topics of natural theology is that of the
        existence of God, and one of the a posteriori arguments for this is the
        argument from design or the teleological argument. The argument is that
        the existence of God can be proved by the design that is obvious in the
        complexity of the world, which Encyclopædia Britannica states is "the
        most popular", because it is:[unreliable source?]
      </p>
      <p>
        ...the most accessible of the theistic arguments ... which identifies
        evidences of design in nature, inferring from them a divine designer ...
        The fact that the universe as a whole is a coherent and efficiently
        functioning system likewise, in this view, indicates a divine
        intelligence behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, Hume wrote that the design
        argument seems to depend upon our experience, and its proponents "always
        suppose the universe, an effect quite singular and unparalleled, to be
        the proof of a Deity, a cause no less singular and unparalleled".
        Philosopher Louise E. Loeb (2010) notes that Hume is saying that only
        experience and observation can be our guide to making inferences about
        the conjunction between events. However, according to Hume:
      </p>
      <p>
        We observe neither God nor other universes, and hence no conjunction
        involving them. There is no observed conjunction to ground an inference
        either to extended objects or to God, as unobserved causes.

        Hume also criticised the argument in his Dialogues Concerning Natural
        Religion (1779). Hume proposes a finite universe with a finite number of
        particles. Given infinite time, these particles could randomly fall into
        any arrangement, including our seemingly designed world.

        A century later, the idea of order without design was rendered more
        plausible by Charles Darwin's discovery that the adaptations of the
        forms of life result from the natural selection of inherited
        characteristics.[unreliable source?] For philosopher James D. Madden, it
        is "Hume, rivaled only by Darwin, [who] has done the most to undermine
        in principle our confidence in arguments from design among all figures
        in the Western intellectual tradition".

        Finally, Hume discussed a version of the anthropic principle, which is
        the idea that theories of the universe are constrained by the need to
        allow for man's existence in it as an observer. Hume has his sceptical
        mouthpiece Philo suggest that there may have been many worlds, produced
        by an incompetent designer, whom he called a "stupid mechanic". In his
        Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, Hume wrote:
      </p>
      <p>
        Many worlds might have been botched and bungled throughout an eternity,
        ere this system was struck out: much labour lost: many fruitless trials
        made: and a slow, but continued improvement carried on during infinite
        ages in the art of world-making.
      </p>

        American philosopher Daniel Dennett has suggested that this mechanical
        explanation of teleology, although "obviously ... an amusing
        philosophical fantasy", anticipated the notion of natural selection, the
        'continued improvement' being like "any Darwinian selection algorithm".
