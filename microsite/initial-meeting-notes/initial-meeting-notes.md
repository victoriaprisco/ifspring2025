# Initial Meeting

We discussed two approaches, both being clean and simple. The first could be warm colors and the second cool colors; but there should be relatively few colors across the site. Potential styles for different sections of the subpages could be different shades of one or two overarching colors. 

There should be a sticky nav bar that links to the separate sections on the page.

The images provided on the wiki page should be enough, but if you feel like there should be more images, you could definitely supplement with google images.

The different sections should be on the same page, but linked to in the nav bar. The titles should be larger text than the body text, but they should blend in with the rest of the text.
