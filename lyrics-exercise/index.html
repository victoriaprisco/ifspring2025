        You could absolutely break my heart<br>
        That's how I know that we're in love<br>
        I don't need the symbol of a scar<br>
        So put down the knife, we're not swapping blood<br>
        Isn't it enough that we stripped down to our skin?<br>
        Cold and porcelain like bathers in a painting<br>
        And I told you of your past lives, every man you've ever been<br>
        It wasn't flattering, but you listened like it mattered<br>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
        I feel crazy in ways I never say<br>
        Will you still love me if it turns out I'm insane?<br>
        I know what you'll say, but it helps to hear you say it anyway<br>

    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
        Some October in the future, I'll run out of trash TV<br>
        And I'll be feeling lonely, so I'll walk to karaokе<br>
        Sing the song you wrote about me, nеver once checking the words<br>
        I hope that no one sings along, I hope that I'm not a regular<br>

    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
        Damn, that makes me sad<br>
        It doesn't have to be like that<br>
        If you rewrite your life, may I still play a part?<br>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
        In the next one, will you find me?<br>
        I'll be the boy with the pink carnation pinned to my lapel<br>
        Who looks like hell and asks for help<br>
        And if you do, I'll know it's you<br>
        I can't imagine you without the same smile in your eyes<br>
        There is somethin' about you that I will always recognize<br>
        And if you don't remember<br>
        I will try to remind you of the hummingbirds<br>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
        You know the ones (I know the ones)<br>
        And the baby scorpion<br>
        And the winter lunar halo<br>
        And the walk we took in the Redwoods<br>

    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
        I could go on and on and on and I will<br>
        <span id="on">Go on and on and on until<br></span>
        <span id="back">It all comes back<br></span>
